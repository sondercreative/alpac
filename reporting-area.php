				<h2>Introduction</h2>
			    <p>Monitoring biodiversity is an important part of Al-Pac’s responsible forest management strategy to evaluate the effectiveness of management actions and continually improve results. The ABMI is part of Alberta’s monitoring systems. We measure the health of biodiversity and changes in human land use (i.e. human footprint) in Alberta, including the Al-Pac FMA area. Our biodiversity data and human footprint data are designed to assess whether forest management activities are meeting their goal of maintaining species in the presence of other cumulative effects, such as energy development in the boreal forest.</p>

				<p>This report is the five year update on the status of biodiversity in the Al-Pac FMA area, the third update since status was first assessed in 2009 and updated in 2015.<sup>[1,2]</sup> In this report, we describe the status of land cover, species, and habitat elements in the Al-Pac FMA area using field data collected between 2003 and 2017, and human footprint data available from 1999 to 2017. We examine the status of hundreds of species and highlight results for those species that are associated with old deciduous and mixedwood forest. We also assess the status of non-native species, and species designated as at risk. We summarize the status of habitat elements, core natural habitat, and area of human footprint including information on the trend of human footprint over the past 18 years. Information from this report can be used as a foundation for evaluating the sustainability of forest management practices that are designed to maintain biodiversity in the Al-Pac FMA area.</p>

				<h2>About the Al-Pac FMA</h2>
				<p>The Al-Pac FMA area covers approximately 63,700 km2 in the Boreal Forest Natural Region of northeastern Alberta.</p>
				<p>The region where Al-Pac’s FMA area is located includes<sup>[7]</sup>:</p>

				<ul>
						<li>A mosaic of upland forests composed mainly of Trembling Aspen, Balsam Poplar, White Spruce, White Birch, and Jack Pine, and lowland forests composed of Black Spruce and Larch</li>

						<li>1.9 million hectares of potentially harvestable* forest, mainly upland Trembling Aspen and White Spruce forest</li>

						<li>4.9 million hectares of wetlands, non-commercial black spruce stands and non-harvestable forest areas (river valleys, slopes, and riparian buffers)</li>

						<li>Large areas leased for oil and gas development and its associated infrastructures, such as roads and utilities</li>

						<li>Socially and economically valued activities including hunting, fishing, trapping, and other recreational pursuits</li>

					<h2>Al-Pac FMA Boundary</h2>

					<p>The Al-Pac FMA area covers approximately 63,700 km2 in northeastern Alberta. The Al-Pac FMA area boundary has not changed significantly since the 2015 ABMI biodiversity report update. </p>

					<p>Prior to 2015, portions of the FMA area were removed as a result of the treaty land entitlement process settled between the governments of Canada, Alberta and Bigstone Cree Nation. Deletions and additions to the FMA boundary also occurred as a result of the Government of Alberta’s Lower Athabasca Regional Plan in 2012.<sup>[6]</sup> </p>

					<p>Within the FMA, Al-Pac primarily harvests deciduous trees, Trembling Aspen and Balsam Poplar, but also harvests small amounts of birch and other species. Other forest companies and quota holders that operate in the FMA area harvest conifer species such as White Spruce, Black Spruce and Jack Pine. Between 1993 to 2011, Al-Pac and other forest companies harvested about 250,000 hectares, which represents two per cent of the total FMA area and about six per cent of the commercially productive forest.<sup>[5]</sup> </p>

					<h2>About the Area of Ecological Influence</h2>

					<p>The Area of Ecological Influence was originally created as a focus area for assessing gaps in the conservation areas network in and around the forest management areas of both FMAs Alberta-Pacific Forest Industries Inc. (Al-Pac) and Mistik Management Ltd (Mistik) as part of a collaborative effort with CPAWS (Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society) and Ducks Unlimited Canada, assessing gaps in the conservation areas network in and around both FMAs to support voluntary commitments as Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC®)certified companies. The AEI is an ecologically based analysis unit defined by all Ecodistricts which overlaps both FMAs. While the AEI extends across the Alberta-Saskatchewan border, the AEI in this status report only considers the area in Alberta.</p>

					<p>Wetlands provide a number of important ecological benefits, such as: critical habitat for wildlife; water filtration and storage, as well as flood protection, and; carbon storage. Over 40% of the Alpac FMA area is classified into six categories of wetlands (Figure xx; Table xx). Fens (also known as muskeg) is the most common wetland type, covering 28.9% of the area </p>

					<h2>Fire History</h2>

					<p>Fire is the principal natural disturbance in the boreal forest; more than 10,000 km2 of the FMA area has burned since 2000 (Table 01, Figure 02).[5] The frequency of fires along with other natural disturbances like insect outbreaks and disease, results in a mosaic of stands of different ages from young forests to forests more than 150 years old.</p>
